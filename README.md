Finally, between 1998 and 2000, there appeared Ian Kershaw’s much-lauded two-volume biography which, asserts Ullrich, attempted to demonstrate that “Hitler didn’t need to do very much at all since German society – everyone from the underlings surrounding him to ordinary people on the street – were increasingly inclined to anticipate and fulfil the Führer’s every wish, ‘working towards him’.”

Ullrich, meanwhile, justifies adding to the Matterhorn of material on Hitler because there has been of late much documentation that was not available to previous biographers. On top of which, he remains an enigma, the inner man, the real man, as elusive as the Loch Ness Monster.

This, the first of two volumes, is sub-titled Ascent, and takes us to the outbreak of war. Running to almost 1,000 pages, it is painstaking in avoiding judgment and careful not to fall into the trap of belittling, sensationalising and damning Hitler. What emerges is perhaps the most revealing and persuasive portrait we are likely see of the man who persuaded an entire people to become part of a cult that would lead to its near destruction. There is much, inevitably, about party politics and internecine squabbles, all of which shows that, when it came to venality, double-dealing and sheer vindictiveness, Hitler could teach House of Cards’ Frank Underwood a thing or two. From time to time, Ullrich interrupts his chronological narrative to stand back and discuss aspects of his subject’s life in an attempt to address the failure of those biographers who were of the opinion that “the Führer did not have a private life”.
